# Master in Big Data Solutions Guide Repository

Welcome to the guide repository. In this README you have some tips and all the different sections that your repo's README shoud contain.

# Names

You can provide a table with the names and the contact of all of the participants as follows:

| Name | Mail |
| ---- | ---- |
| Jordi Hurtado | hurtadosabatejordi@gmail.com |
| Mahmoud Belhaj Ahmed  | mahmoud.belhajahmed@gmail.com  |
| Benjamin Wein | benjaminjameswein@gmail.com
It is important to add your contact name as other people could use your code and may require any help.


Few lines explaining what your project consist on is always useful, so people don't have to read the code to understand what you are doing.

We will go through two main stages for this project. The first one will be Data collection, which consists of 
assigning data to each variable that will be useful for the second part of the project:  Analysis and visualization. 
In this second part we will extract some statistics and perform graphs to ultimately be able to state some conclusions about it.


You should include some lines explaining the dataset you are using, together with the link where you can download the data (if dealing with a public dataset).

The Dataset is called Titanic and includes several variables. Variables considered are: PassengerId (type should be integers), 
Survived (Survived or Not), Pclass (Class of Travel), Name (Name of Passenger), Sex, Gende, Age, SibSp (Number of Sibling/Spouse abord), 
Parch (Number of Parent/Child abord), Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked (The port in which a passenger has embarked. C - Cherbourg, 
S - Southampton, Q = Queenstown).

#Files and usage
You should explain all the files that you include, as well as how to use them.

train.csv: This file contains the core of the project. 

For example

    main.py: This file contains the core of the project.
    plot_graphs.py: This file contains functions that graph data into different formats
    ...
    ...
**Usage**: Run the following command line into your terminal:

    python main.py
    
# Examples
If convenient, show some examples of the results you obtained during the project. 
    
# References
A list of references of other works that you may have used. At least the reference to the dataset must be included.
